### Hi there 👋🏽, my name is Jhon Colorado
I'm a **Front-end Developer** from Colombia living in Colombia.

I will mention some of the technologies and languages that I use: HTML, CSS, SASS, Web Accessibility, JQuery, JavaScript, ReactJS, MySQL, Docker and currently learning NextJS, UX and English.

Passionate about technology 💻, I am always interacting, reading and researching about new technologies, reviewing topics and languages that I already know.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a small personal application with ReactJS
- 🌱 I'm currently training in NextJS, UX and English
